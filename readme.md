# 🗂️ Kanban Board

A simple and interactive **Kanban Board** web application to manage tasks visually across different workflow stages like **To-Do**, **In-Progress**, and **Done**. The project is inspired by agile project management principles and focuses on clean UI, smooth drag-and-drop, and persistent task storage.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are represented as draggable cards.
- Columns act as drop zones.
- When a task is dragged and dropped, it is moved in the DOM.
- Task data (title & description) is synced to `localStorage`.
- On page reload, tasks are restored from stored data.
